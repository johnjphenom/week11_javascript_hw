# UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose

The goal of the project is to help Dana, a data journalist, create a website detailing information about UFO sightings. She begins with a large JavaScript filled with information about different UFO sightings. The website will include a table of the information she possesses and will be presented in the form of a filterable table. Through input fields (Date, City, State, Country, and Shape) the user is able to input different parameters which will filter the data in the table. This will then present the results that match up with given search parameters. 

## Results
After much work a successfully working website, that is aesthetically pleasing, was generated. Through the use of JavaScript one is now able to enter information into the search fields and get the desired results. On enters the information into the specific search field and after exiting the particular field then the search results are generated. It can be as simple as entering information into one field or up to filling out all five. When entering info into more fields the search is narrowed even more so.  After much work the website was competed.

### Examples
Such an example of a search is shown below with the parameters of ‘1/2/2010’, ‘ca’, and ‘triangle’.

Another such example is with the parameters of ‘nm’ and ‘light’. This provides us with one result.

If no parameters are entered, then all of the results are populated. This is also that case when the webpage first starts up.

## Summary
The website that was developed is functional and looks clean and organized as well, however, there are some drawbacks. One such drawback is that the information entered into the field is case sensitive and must be entered exactly as it appears in the table or zero results will be shown. Some possible improvements would be instructions detailing this restriction and setting a range of dates available. Essentially, a legend with instructions below the search fields would be advantageous. For the other fields it would be helpful if the fields were a dropdown menu. This would limit the options for search parameters to those that are present in the table. It would be especially helpful in the ‘Shape’ field because one would just have to guess to possibly get results. The website functions well but with some alterations it would be excellent.
